# RayTracing
A Python script designed to simulate the propagation of rays through heterogeneous media. It models the interaction of rays with different media, allowing the analysis of various scenarios and phenomena such as reflection, refraction, and transmission, providing insights into the behavior of light or other waves in varied environments.
